And then the coder bouhgt a miner,
He had a dream of becoming a developer and buy Bitcoin,
So he went to georgebrown to learn

And registered to GBC course
And completed his certification from Geroge brown and went to industry,
Down by the bay
And get a job in downtown!
Drink a lot beer after everything!
In class he started a promissing project
