Once there was a little blockchainer,
she had a giraffe and was only 90 years old,
Once there was a little blockchainer,

But coding blockchain was hard,
And then the coder bouhgt a miner,
He had a dream of becoming a developer and buy Bitcoin,
So he went to georgebrown to learn...
But got kind of lost because there was so much to learn
